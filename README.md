# Python Calculator using Functions

## Overview
This is a simple yet functional calculator built using Python. The program uses functions to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator is interactive and runs continuously until the user decides to exit.

## Features
- Supports the following operations:
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`*`)
  - Division (`/`)
- Handles invalid inputs gracefully, including:
  - Non-numeric inputs.
  - Division by zero.
- Runs in a loop until the user types `"exit"`, allowing multiple calculations in one session.
- Uses Python's `try` and `except` blocks to handle errors effectively.

## How to Run the Program
1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Burhanali2211/Calculator.git
cd python-calculator
python calculator.py

Enter Your First Number: 10
Select your operator (+, -, *, /) or 'exit' to quit: +
Enter Your Second Number: 5
Result: 15.0

Enter Your First Number: 0
Select your operator (+, -, *, /) or 'exit' to quit: exit
Exiting calculator. Goodbye!
